 * Key points to remember:
 * - Class names should start with an uppercase letter.
 * - Method and variable names should start with a lowercase letter.
 * - Keywords like class, public, static, void, etc., are reserved words in Java.
 * - Modifiers like public, static, and final are used to define the accessibility and behavior of classes, methods, and variables.
